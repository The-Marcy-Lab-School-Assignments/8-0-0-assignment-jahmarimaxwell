# Question

`app.get(endpoint, controller)` takes in a `controller` as the second argument.

What is a controller?

# Answer
Controllers in Express.js are JavaScript functions responsible for handling the logic associated with specific endpoints. When a client sends a request to a particular endpoint, Express invokes the corresponding controller to process the request and generate a response.
